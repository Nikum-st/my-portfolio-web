export const aboutText1 = `
Hi! I’m Nikita, a Frontend Developer from Sakhalin Island, Russia — where winter feels like a boss fight.
 Now I code from sunny Italy, fueled by espresso and a love for clean, user-friendly interfaces. 
I have over 2 years of experience building responsive web applications, landing pages, and corporate websites using React,Next.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS.

`;
export const aboutText2 = `
I’ve worked at Nimax, creating landing pages and corporate sites like AAG and Letovo, and on other projects I built SPA applications. 
I also mentored junior developers at Result University and started my career at Zapal.agency, working on interactive sites like Senior Bay and Showbox. 
I love learning new tech, solving tricky bugs (sometimes at 2 a.m. with coffee ☕), and making code that not only works but also makes people smile.
